multiple interface
every test method on Resolve should be duplicated with TryResolve
named+singleton
multiple RegisterType on same interface but different implementation
     multiple anonymous -> fail at register time
     multiple named -> success if correct name specified
     one anonymous + one named -> success if correct name specified
     one anonymous + multiple named -> success if correct name specified
multiple RegisterType on different interface on a single implementation
test InitializeFromConfig(filename)

add another unit test project with invalid RegisterType chain to validate exception on InitializeFromConfig without breaking other unit tests
